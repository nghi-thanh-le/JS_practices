# JS practices
An simple task using javascript and bootstrap
SAMPLE

TASK 1: THE AGE CALCULATOR
Forgot how old you are? Calculate it!
Write a function named calculateAge() that:
takes 2 arguments: birth year, current year.
calculates the 2 possible ages based on those years.
outputs the result to the screen like so: "You are either NN or NN"
Call the function three times with different sets of values.
Bonus: Figure out how to get the current year in JavaScript instead of passing it in.

TASK 2: THE LIFETIME SUPPLY CALCULATOR
Ever wonder how much a "lifetime supply" of your favorite snack is? Wonder no more!
Write a function named calculateSupply() that:
takes 2 arguments: age, amount per day.
calculates the amount consumed for rest of the life (based on a constant max age).
outputs the result to the screen like so: "You will need NN to last you until the ripe old age of X"
Call that function three times, passing in different values each time.
Bonus: Accept floating point values for amount per day, and round the result to a round number.

TASK 3: THE GEOMETRIZER
Create 2 functions that calculate properties of a circle.
Create a function called calcCircumfrence():
Pass the radius to the function.
Calculate the circumference based on the radius, and output "The circumference is NN".
Create a function called calcArea():
Pass the radius to the function.
Calculate the area based on the radius, and output "The area is NN".

TASK 4: THE TEMPERATURE CONVERTER
It's hot out! Let's make a converter based on the steps here:
°F to °C
Deduct 32, then multiply by 5, then divide by 9
°C to °F
Multiply by 9, then divide by 5, then add 32
Create a function called celsiusToFahrenheit():
Store a celsius temperature into a variable.
Convert it to fahrenheit and output "NN°C is NN°F".
Create a function called fahrenheitToCelsius():
Now store a fahrenheit temperature into a variable.
Convert it to celsius and output "NN°F is NN°C."

TASK 5: PRESENTATION (EXTRA)
This is a chance to show off your HTML and CSS skills.
Design a simple one page website that includes tasks 1 - 4.
The design is up to you, but make it clear to the user which task is which
